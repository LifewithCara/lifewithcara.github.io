                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <img>
                <p>Hi, my name is Akindoju Damilola(no other birth name). My 'not so close' friends call me CaraðŸ˜…. How did the name come about? It's a long, exhausting story. About 4yrs ago, a very close friend of mine at the time woke up one morning, searched the web for about 5mins, found a name and told me 'hey, I found a middle name for you. It's Cara. It means beloved' and I was like 'Yaay, I love itðŸ¤—' and Cara lived happily ever after... I thinkðŸ¤”. 


Anyways... Who am I? Just a crazy Nigerian Christian child with big dreams and an undying love for God, adventure, music, people and food. Don't forget the food part. I am currently a 300l student of Lagos State University, department of Chemistry. 


Writing has always been my 2nd love after breadðŸ˜Š but no, it's not why I opened this blog. I opened this blog cos it was the only thing I could think of to do for my ENT 302 writing and publishing exhibition but I promise I love you guys. 


So, journey with me as I walk you through the diamond in the rough; the beauty in the hustle, the bustle of this 22 million man city. See it too, through my eyes, through the stories I tell, through my heart shaped by the culture of this city. Lagos becomes more delicious when you have extra pairs of eyes and mouth to taste the story.

And that journey starts as you subscribeðŸ˜Š. For now, I'll be posting once a week so stay tuned and stay gluedðŸ‘€. 

Ciao
